<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol class="step-list">
    <li>Mix flour and salt in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Add water or milk gradually, stirring and then gently kneading as you go, until the mixture forms a soft, smooth dough (add more flour if the mixture becomes too wet)</li>
    <li>Roll dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness, and use a round cutter to make 3 1/2-inch circles. (Or separate dough into about 10 pieces, shape each piece into a ball, and flatten each ball into a pancake about 1/4 inch thick). Poke a hole in each center with your finger, which prevents them from puffing up.</li>
    <li>Add enough vegetable oil (or melt enough shortening or lard) in a small skillet to have a depth of about an inch of fat. Heat until fat sizzles when the dough is added. Fry breads in batches until golden brown on both sides, turning them once.</li>
    <li>Drain fried tortas on paper towels and sprinkle with sugar while still hot.</li>
    <li>Serve warm</li>
